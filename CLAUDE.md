# Prestige Hugo Theme

Prestige is a Hugo theme for case-study portfolios. Each project can present a polished **Performance** layer and a structured **Backstage** account of the work. Standalone failure reports live in the **Trapdoor** section.

## Project status

This repository is the standalone theme, not a site using the theme. The theme is implemented from the design specification: layouts, components, shortcodes, render hooks, styles, scripts, fonts, the `exampleSite/` demo and the `tools/` scripts.

The design source of truth is `prestige_design.md` in `stitch_markdown_prestige_system_designer/`. That folder is kept outside the shipped theme: it is gitignored, so a maintainer keeps it locally, and the last tracked copy is [at commit 4e31e69](https://github.com/m0hss/Prestige/blob/4e31e696a2a006be096ba2612a26f602dae78017/stitch_markdown_prestige_system_designer/prestige_design.md). Never commit it back into the repository. Its content model, templates, visual system, accessibility requirements, and acceptance checklist govern changes. Keep that specification unchanged unless asked to revise the design. Where Hugo forced a different mechanism than the spec describes (stylesheet bundling before Hugo 0.158, SVG sizing, `params.kind`, `:contentbasename` permalinks, site-level `[markup]` and `[taxonomies]`), the code comments and README say so.

## Hugo requirements and local use

Use Hugo **extended 0.146.0 or later**. From a site that imports this theme:

```toml
theme = "prestige"
```

Then run:

```bash
hugo server -D
hugo --gc --minify
```

The repository's `.claude/launch.json` starts `hugo server -D --source exampleSite` on port 1313 from the repository root. To work on the theme itself, run `cd exampleSite && hugo server`: the repository is the Hugo Module `github.com/m0hss/Prestige`, and `exampleSite/hugo.toml` imports it with a local replacement (`../..`), so no themes folder or symlink is needed. Run `tools/check-budgets.sh` before committing CSS or JS changes (CSS ≤ 51,200 bytes, JS ≤ 30,720 bytes). Run `tools/check-csp.sh` after touching anything in `<head>` or adding markup.

## Content vocabulary

- **Performance** is the concise, polished result of a case study.
- **Backstage** is the numbered account of the problem, constraints, hypotheses, rejected options, implementation, and measured result.
- **Trapdoor** is a standalone failure report with its own reference, impact or cost, cause, and changed behavior.
- Case studies are Hugo page bundles under `content/work/<slug>/`. Their `index.md` is Performance; optional `backstage.md` and `steps/*.md` resources hold the process.
- Trapdoor reports are regular pages under `content/trapdoor/`.

See the `issue-to-case-study` and `incident-to-trapdoor` skills in `.claude/skills/` for evidence-based drafting workflows. Keep new drafts marked `draft: true` unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.

## Implementation notes

Templates use the Hugo 0.146 layout system (`layouts/_partials/`, `layouts/_shortcodes/`, `layouts/_markup/`). Every user-visible string lives in `i18n/en.toml`. Only `assets/css/tokens.css` may contain colour values. Both modes share one size scale (the Backstage values in `tokens.css`): a mode changes colour, border style, radius and shadow, never a typeface or a size (Backstage uses the Performance type: same families, weights, line heights and tracking). Do not size `:root` by mode, and write font-relative widths in `em`, not `ch`. Content is never put in JavaScript, and nothing is hidden except under `html.js` gating. The site runs under a strict CSP (`layouts/home.headers`): no `style=""` attributes or inline event handlers, and the only inline `<script>`/`<style>` are the two built and hashed in `layouts/_partials/lib/inline-assets.html`. Any new link URL from content or config goes through `lib/url-ok.html`.

Hugo reserves `kind` as page metadata: a top-level `kind:` in a step file is an error on Hugo 0.150 and deprecated on later releases. Step files therefore write the design spec's step `kind` under `params:` (`params: { kind: problem }`); templates read it as `.Params.kind`.

The only repository is `github.com/m0hss/Prestige` (also the module path); every GitHub link points there, and `demosite` in `theme.toml` is the demo's Netlify address, `https://prestige-hugo.netlify.app/` (deployed by `netlify.toml`). The theme author is FixByte Studio. Releases are semver tags (`v0.1.0` onwards) on `master`, as Hugo Modules expect.

## Safety and accuracy

- Never invent measurements, causes, outcomes, or evidence. Mark unknowns as TODOs in drafts.
- Do not include secrets, credentials, customer data, private IPs, or internal hostnames in public content.
- Keep the fictional examples in the design specification clearly identified as examples; they are not facts about a real project.
- Draft content for review. Do not publish, deploy, or post externally unless explicitly asked.
